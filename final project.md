# Final Project 'Behind the Scenes'

## The Idea

### 1. The Project Outline
* teaser: a new aesthetic paradigm: a more nostalgic and romanticized version of Kowloon Walled City portrayed by popular media and game outlets
* Introduction: the city of darkness. History background
* Why special: high population density + inhabitants growth uncontrolled construction 1960-1990 
* Reason why more people choose to live in there:
1. rent
Who lived there? The story of inhabitants . 
sharing of living quarters among households
2. business and factory establishments
* 1994: the demolition . where did the people go?
* call to action: 
It is not just a cluster of buildings. It is a representative, a symbol of Hong Kong – hardworking, the perseverance to improve life in such a crowded space, the spirit of struggling. It represents certain values or spirit of struggle and resistance. 
Maybe a better solution instead of evictions and clearance? UN Sustainable Development Goal No.11: Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
To achieve slum reduction, poliymaker should focus on preventing slums from forming, instead of mass evictions

### 2. Summary of the Project
This is a story about a place in Hong Kong called Kowloon Walled City that was demolished in 1994. It represents a unique and irreplaceable urban life and collective community memory. Therefore, this data visualization will give an inside look at how people living their life in Kowloon Walled City, a place they call, home.

### 3. Data source
I will use multiple datasets. The main datasource of Kowloon Walled City is from a research paper: Ho, S., University of Hong Kong Centre of Urban Studies, and Urban Planning. Redevelopment of Kowloon Walled City: A Feasibility Study, 1986. These data about the population, demographics, and business in KWC are all collected in 1990s.

### Method and Medium
I will use shorthand to build the story. Because I think Shorthand is a useful tool to put all the multimedia materials together and achieve audience engagement. I will create an immersive experience by using text over media, BG scrollmation, image and video. Besides its cyberpunk elements and aesthtic value, the story will be more about the residents and their real life. Therefore, historical photos and videos will be used to ‘recreate’ the demolished city.

## Design and User Research

### User Research
#### Target Audience
people interested in urban history and urban development. 
Cyberpunk fan

#### Goals
1. Evaluate if the storytelling narrative is clear enough
2. Evaluate if the data visualizations effective in telling story
3. Identify the unclear and confusing parts and what needs to be fixed

#### Research questions
1.	Have you heard about this story before? Do you understand what this story is about?
2.	What part of the presentation is confusing?
3.	Did you notice any problem need to be fixed?
4.	What is your strongest feeling after this presentation?
5.	Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?
6.	Who is the primary audience for this? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?

#### Script:
I interviewed three people from different background: Journalism, Econ & Finance Policy, and Arts Management, 2 female, 1 male. One of them are familar with Cyberpunk culture. I hope they can bring different perspectives to this project.

<img src="A4.png" width="800" />
<img src="A5.png" width="800" />

#### Findings:
1. Unclear parts: the ending of KWC. Housing crisis graph. The connection between the graph and context. 
2. Graph need to be improved: density graph (can be misundertood as the size?) change to a better way to show population density
3. too much text + no background color--> use dark color to set the tone


## Final data story
### Intended Audience
The intended audience will be people who are interested in urban history and urban development, and policymakers. 
I told the story of KWC from different dimensions: its history timeline, real data of population and changes through time combining the social contexts back that time. The data could effectively demonstrate what kind of existance KWC was that time, and what happened in Hong Kong: the issue of rapid population growth and housing shortages. I think these will be working well in enagaging those who are interested in urban history and sociology. Also I used various media tools such as images and documentary to keep the audience engaged. 

### Relection on the work
1. The most challenging part for me is that how to make your story compelling, that is, how to make your audience be the hero of your story, and what is your call to action, what you want your audience get from your story.
Especially nowadays, when people's attention has become a scarce commodity, and everyone is trying to sell people their ideas, 
answering the question 'why would I care about what you are saying' is the key to tell the story successfully.

2. Doing user research is crucial in ensuring the whole story engaging. This step helped me improve my story structure a lot.
