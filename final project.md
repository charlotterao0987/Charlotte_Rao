# Final Project 'Behind the Scenes'

## The Idea

### 1. The Project Outline
* teaser: a new aesthetic paradigm: a more nostalgic and romanticized version of Kowloon Walled City portrayed by popular media and game outlets
* Introduction: the city of darkness. History background
* Why special: high population density + inhabitants growth uncontrolled construction 1960-1990 
* Reason why more people choose to live in there:
1. rent
Who lived there? The story of inhabitants . 
sharing of living quarters among households
2. business and factory establishments
* 1994: the demolition . where did the people go?
* call to action: 
It is not just a cluster of buildings. It is a representative, a symbol of Hong Kong – hardworking, the perseverance to improve life in such a crowded space, the spirit of struggling. It represents certain values or spirit of struggle and resistance. 
Maybe a better solution instead of evictions and clearance? UN Sustainable Development Goal No.11: Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
To achieve slum reduction, poliymaker should focus on preventing slums from forming, instead of mass evictions

### 2. Summary of the Project
This is a story about a place in Hong Kong called Kowloon Walled City that was demolished in 1994. It represents a unique and irreplaceable urban life and collective community memory. Therefore, this data visualization will give an inside look at how people living their life in Kowloon Walled City, a place they call, home.

### 3. Data source
I will use multiple datasets. The main datasource of Kowloon Walled City is from a research paper: Ho, S., University of Hong Kong Centre of Urban Studies, and Urban Planning. Redevelopment of Kowloon Walled City: A Feasibility Study, 1986. These data about the population, demographics, and business in KWC are all collected in 1990s.

### Method and Medium
I will use shorthand to build the story. Because I think Shorthand is a useful tool to put all the multimedia materials together and achieve audience engagement. I will create an immersive experience by using text over media, BG scrollmation, image and video. Besides its cyberpunk elements and aesthtic value, the story will be more about the residents and their real life. Therefore, historical photos and videos will be used to ‘recreate’ the demolished city.
