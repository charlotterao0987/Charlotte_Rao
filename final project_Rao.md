# An outline

For the final project, I want to tell the story of **Hong Kong Kowloon Walled City (九龙城寨）**, once the most crowded place on Earth. It is well known for its dark and bizzare side: anarchy, slum, crime, lawless, cyberpunk...But Kowloon Walled City is more than just these descriptions. It represents a unique and irreplaceable urban life and collective community memory. Therefore, this data visualization will give an inside look at how people living their life in Kowloon Walled City, a place they call, home.
