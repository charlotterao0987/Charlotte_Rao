# An outline

For the final project, I want to tell the story of **Hong Kong Kowloon Walled City (九龙寨城）**, once the most crowded place on Earth. It is well known for its dark and bizzare side: dystopia, anarchy, slum, crime, lawless, cyberpunk...But Kowloon Walled City is more than just these descriptions. **It represents a unique and irreplaceable urban life and collective community memory.** Therefore, this data visualization will give an inside look at how people living their life in Kowloon Walled City, a place they call, home.

**Story Structure:**
1. teaser: **a new aesthetic paradigm**: a more nostalgic and romanticized version protrayed by popular media and game outlets
2. Introduction: the city of darkness. background 
3. population density + inhabitants growth 
uncontrolled construction
1960-1990 the housing affordability crisis
hong kong housing price 
4. Reason why more people choose to live in there---rent 
5. Who lived in there? The story of inhabitants
* demographic structure 
* pictures showing sharing of living quarters among households
“life was poor, but we were very happy’
oral history + picture
* business and factory establishments
oral history + picture
6. 1994: the demolition
where did the people go?
7. **call to action: beyond the striking images: care about and respect the people behind**
Although it looks like a dystopia, nobody can deny the fact that the Kowloon Walled City once provided those in need with a place called home.

# The data
A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 


# Method and Medium
I will use shorthand to build the story. Because I think Shorthand is a useful tool to put all the multimedia materials together and achieve audience engagement. I will create an immersive experience by using text over media, BG scrollmation, image and video. Besides its cyberpunk elements and aesthtic value, the story will be more about the residents and their real life. Therefore, historical photos and videos will be used to 'recreate' the demolished city.
