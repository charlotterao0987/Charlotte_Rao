# Charlotte Rao - Portfolio

Hi :) This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data Class at CMU . 

# About me
My name is Shunyu (Charlotte) Rao, she/her/hers . 
Arts Management Program 2020  

Studied Public Administration in China, Social Policy in Edinburgh, and Cultural and Arts Management in Bologna, Italy . 

I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of arts and social science . 
I am planning to create community-engaged arts program that could address social issues, and support community development and urban development. Therefore, I believe data visualization is a extremely crucial tool for me to tell stories to various audience, including policy makers, communities and the mass public.

# What I hope to learn
* **Strategy:** How to present a visualization suitable for the subject and audience
* **Methodology:** How to communicate my research effectively to the audience, especially the public who has no background in this field 
* **Technical Tool:** Get familar with various design and visualization tools and platforms
